# Getting Started

This guide walks you through creating your own TabulaKit documentation site from scratch.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed
- The [Claude Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anthropic.claude-code) installed in VS Code
- If using Windows: [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) set up, and VS Code connected to WSL as a remote

## Step 1: Create Your Site

Open VS Code, launch Claude Code, and paste this prompt:

```text
I want to create a documentation site using TabulaKit. Here's what I need you to do:

1. Check if gh (GitHub CLI) is installed. If not, install it.
2. Check if I'm authenticated with gh auth status. If not, run gh auth login and walk me through it. When it asks about token expiration, recommend "No expiration" so the token doesn't stop working later.
3. Ask me what I want to name my repo and give a one-line description.
4. Create a new repo from the TabulaKit template by running:
   gh repo create MY-SITE --template heatherstoneio/tabulakit --public --clone
   (Replace MY-SITE with my answer from step 3.)
5. After cloning, cd into the new repo directory.
6. Write a file at CLAUDE.md (in the repo root, NOT inside .claude/) with this content:

# Setup Instructions

This is a freshly forked TabulaKit site that hasn't been configured yet.
Site description: [use the description from step 3]

On the NEXT session (after this one), the .claude/ folder will be active
with full project context, permissions, and skills.

When the user returns, tell them: "Welcome back! Your TabulaKit repo is
ready. Type /startup to configure your site."

After /startup completes, delete this root CLAUDE.md file — the real
project context lives in .claude/CLAUDE.md.

7. Commit that file: git add CLAUDE.md && git commit -m "docs: add setup breadcrumb for first session"
8. Push: git push origin main
9. Tell me to click the "New Session" button at the top of the Claude Code panel to start a fresh session so the settings and skills take effect.

NOTE: During this first session you'll see permission prompts for every action — that's normal. Once the new session starts inside the repo, permissions are pre-configured and you won't be prompted anymore.

If anything fails, explain what went wrong and help me fix it. I may be non-technical.
```

Claude Code will handle everything — installing tools, authenticating with GitHub, creating your repo, and setting things up. Just answer its questions.

When it tells you to restart, **close the Claude Code session** and **open a new one** from your new repo folder.

## Step 2: Run the Setup Wizard

After restarting Claude Code in your new repo, type:

```
/startup
```

The wizard walks you through:

1. **Site name & description** — what to call your site
2. **Template** — pick a starting structure (blank, mission planning, or course/workshop)
3. **Theme color** — choose from presets or enter a custom color
4. **Deployment target** — where your site will live (GitHub Pages, Firebase, or Netlify)
5. **Authentication** — if using Firebase, choose who can access your site
6. **Command Architecture** — optional organizational framework module

Answer the questions and the wizard configures everything for you.

## Step 3: Deploy

The wizard tells you exactly what to do based on your deployment choice. Here's a quick summary:

**GitHub Pages** (simplest):
1. Go to your repo on GitHub → **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Set Source to **GitHub Actions**
3. Push your changes — the site deploys automatically

**Firebase** (if you need access control):
1. Follow the steps in the [Firebase guide](deploy-firebase.md)

**Netlify** (deploy previews on pull requests):
1. Follow the steps in the [Netlify guide](deploy-netlify.md)

## Step 4: Add Content

Your site is live! Now just talk to Claude Code:

- *"Add a new page about our onboarding process"*
- *"Change the theme color to green"*
- *"Add a section header called Resources to the sidebar"*
- *"Help me write documentation about X"*

Or do it manually:

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `site/` folder
2. Add a link to it in `site/_sidebar.md`
3. Push your changes — the site updates automatically

## Writing Content

TabulaKit uses [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) to render markdown files as a single-page application. Key features:

- **No build step** — edit markdown, refresh browser
- **Sidebar navigation** — defined in `_sidebar.md`
- **Full-text search** — built in
- **Dark theme** — default, customizable via config

### Sidebar Navigation

Edit `site/_sidebar.md` to control the navigation:

```markdown
- [Page Title](filename.md)
- **SECTION HEADER**
- [Another Page](another.md)
```

### Local Preview

To preview your site on your own computer before pushing:

```bash
npx live-server site --port=3000
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. Changes appear when you refresh.
